## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Commit Your Changes
```bash
cd neural-quest
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment: Remove canvas webpack config and add SSR guards"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Verify on Vercel
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Wait for automatic deployment (triggered by your push)
3. Check the deployment logs - should show "Build Successful"

### Step 3: Access Your Site
Your site should now be live at: `https://your-project.vercel.app`

## ✅ What Was Fixed

**The Problem:**
- `canvas` module externalization caused Vercel serverless to fail
- Server couldn't initialize, returning 404 for all routes
- SSR hydration issues with Zustand store

**The Solution:**
- Removed webpack canvas externalization (not needed for client-side canvas)
- Added client-side mounting guards
- Enhanced window/browser checks

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

1. ✅ Landing page loads correctly
2. ✅ Navigation works between zones
3. ✅ Animations render properly
4. ✅ Chatbot opens and functions
5. ✅ No console errors

## 📝 Important Notes

- The CSS warning about `@import` is harmless and can be ignored
- All features are now Vercel-compatible
- Static generation works correctly
- Client-side rendering is optimized

## 🎉 Result

Your portfolio should now deploy successfully to Vercel without any 404 errors!
